Those are the algorithms and the data structures I've learned so far. I used to write down each one to enforce
learning it, but they were scattered and all over the place. So, I've gathered them into one single folder, and
I will keep adding to it as I learn even more.

This represents my personal journey, so I will not accept any pull requests or incoming changes. Thanks for
understanding.
